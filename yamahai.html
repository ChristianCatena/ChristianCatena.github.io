            <p class="font-monospace">Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd (ヤマハ発動機株式会社 Yamaha Hatsudōki Kabushikigaisha) is a manufacturer of motorized vehicles, motorcycles, and marine engines. It was established on July 1, 1955, as a spin-off from Yamaha Corporation, which was initially Nippon Gakki founded in 1897 and established itself as a manufacturer of organs and pianos. It is indeed known as "The House of the Three Tuning Forks," depicted in its symbol in reference to the origins of the parent company.

                Yamaha is the second-largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world by size, after its compatriot Honda.

                <p class="mb-1">Yamaha has been an engine manufacturer for the Formula 1 World Championship, supplying various teams, in 1989 and from 1991 to 1997.

                    In 1997, as the engine supplier for Arrows, it came close to victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix when Damon Hill, firmly leading the race, had a gearbox problem on the last lap. That second place remains one of the best results in Grand Prix racing, alongside a third place by Mark Blundell in Tyrrell in 1994.</p>
